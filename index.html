            <h2>Brainstrome</h2>
            <p>Our team created a variety of ideas and views to address the water scarcity issue in Kathmandu during the ideate process. We had brainstorming sessions and investigatedseveral techniques to solve the problem.Initially, we considered grand solutions that would necessitate significant investment andcomplex infrastructure. However, as we dug deeper into the issue and considered thefeasibility of our proposals, we realized that our solution needed to be both accessible andcost-effective. We wanted to provide a solution that anyone, regardless of financialmeans, could use.</p>

                        <div>Initially, we intended to direct the gathered rainwater to the rechargeable well. Wequickly realized, however, that not everyone has access to the well, and we needed to findalternative options.</div>

                        <div>We considered installing a reserve tank to store water here at first. However, we realizedthat not everyone could afford the costs of constructing a reserve tank, which can be quitecostly. As a result, we started to investigate various low-cost alternatives that could serveas viable solutions to the water storage problem.</div>

                        <div>We have developed a portable rainwater collection system using water buckets and waterdrums. This system is affordable and easy to assemble, making it accessible to everyone.Additionally, we have designed the system to allow for stacking of multiple containers,providing ample water storage capacity in a compact footprint. With this system,individuals and households can collect and store rainwater for their daily needs withoutbreaking the bank.</div>
